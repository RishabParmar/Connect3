Connect3 is the first android based game that I have built in order to improve my hands on with the Android framework and its core concepts. You can find the entire source code to refer to and also build your own version out of it!
It's a no nonsense free to play game with no ads and simplistic gameplay.

I have managed to include fluid animations and sounds for a rich yet simple to use design. Credits to freesound.org for the music for this game.

Unfortunately, I won't be releasing this app on Google Play Store, but feel absolutely free to clone this project, run it in your Android Studio and install it on your phone by connecting it directly to your PC while running the app! Happy playing and learning!
